This is where I would like to put my CV spelled out in a nice way with links that are eligble to be read. For example:

## Education

<img src="C:\DOcs\MylesHEinhornweb\Johns_Hopkins_Logo.png" alt = "Johns Hopkins University Logo" width = "400" height = "800">
Johns Hopkins University Baltimore, MD


icon for Seton Hall University with the link to some stuff but probably not all

## Experience
