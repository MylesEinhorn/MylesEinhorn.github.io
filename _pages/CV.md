This is where I would like to put my CV spelled out in a nice way with links that are eligble to be read. For example:

## Education

icon for Johns Hopkins University with the link to statistical analysis concentration
Description for Johns Hopkins University

icon for Seton Hall University with the link to some stuff but probably not all

## Experience

Here is where I can get into the mock trial gig, Meyner and Landis, as well as the teaching gig and Arc Aspicio
